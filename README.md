# StockJockey
A platform to bring detailed investment analysis to the amateur inverstors. Analyze stocks quickly and easily to streamline trade decisions.

## Overview
StockJockey is an application for evaluating stocks and automating financial processes. The initial evaluation is based on the Nasdaq Dozen analysis method. It provides a score from 0 (worst) to 12 (best) for an input stock which allows fast, direct comparison between stocks. As the project grows, the goal is to provide additional financial insights to individuals, groups, and businesses that are looking to simplify or automate their financial workflows.

## Usage
StockJockey is currently under construction. It will be available to the public after its initial release.

Currently the platform is optimized for a Google Chrome desktop environment.

## Architecture
The platform is a Python Flask app with a data-processing backend to support machine learning functions. It is served as a web application and is currently available only through special access until its initial release.

## Future Updates
